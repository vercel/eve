 *    deployer named their app. Fetched with the deployment's OIDC token and
 *    cached for the life of the instance.
 *
 * Throws when the metadata is unreachable or carries no usable slug, and the
 * failure is never cached. That contract is what the channel's lazy `botName`
 * resolution relies on: eve calls this on first use inside request handling
 * (where the OIDC token exists), caches a fulfilled name, and retries a
 * rejection on the next event, so a transient outage can't pin a wrong name.
 * Callers that need an answer no matter what catch and use
 * {@link FALLBACK_BOT_NAME}.
 *
 * A hardcoded name is wrong here because the app's slug is chosen by whoever
 * registers it, and a guessed handle can belong to a real GitHub user.
